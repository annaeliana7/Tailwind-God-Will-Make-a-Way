                        <p>God will make a way</p>
                        <p>Where there seems to be no way</p>
                        <p>He works in ways we cannot see</p>
                        <p>He will make a way for me</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>He will be my guide</p>
                        <p>Hold me closely to His side</p>
                        <p>With love and strength for each new day</p>
                        <p>He will make a way, He will make a way</p>
                        <p>(Sing it together)</p>

                        <p>With love and strength for each new day</p>
                        <p>He will make a way, He will make a way</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me</p>
                        <p>(Rivers in the desert)</p>
                        <p>Rivers in the desert will I see</p>
                        <p>Heaven and earth will fade but His Word will still remain</p>
                        <p>And He will do something new today</p>

                        <p>Who might be here tonight</p>

                        <p>About your situation, but He hasn't</p>
                        <p>The Bible says that we are inscribe in the palm of His hand</p>
                        <p>And Heaven and earth may pass away</p>
                        <p>But His word will remain forever</p>
                        <p>And He can do exceeding, abundantly</p>
                        <p>Above all that we could ever ask or think tonight (amen)</p>
                        <p>Amen, let's sing it</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Oh, God will make a way</p>

                        <p>He works in ways we cannot see</p>
                        <p>He will make a way for me</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>He will be my guide</p>
